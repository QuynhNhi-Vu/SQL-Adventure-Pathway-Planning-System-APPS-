# SQL Adventure Pathway Planning System(APPS)

## Overview
Sydney is composed of multiple local council areas, each with its own unique landscapes and attractions. To promote outdoor activities and tourism, the NSW State Government has initiated the development of an Adventure Pathway Planning System (APPS). This system will allow both locals and tourists to explore treks, hikes, bike rides, and historical tours in a self-guided manner.

## Project Goal:  
- Plan and save custom adventure routes.  
- Explore points of interest, including flora, fauna, landmarks, and historical sites.  
- Contribute by suggesting new paths and reviewing existing routes.  
- Support tourism and local exploration by integrating data from multiple stakeholders.  

## Features
- **Adventure Planning:** Users can create, modify, and save personalized adventure routes.
- **Point of Interest (POI) Integration:** Landmarks, wildlife, and historical sites are mapped along routes.
- **Data Management:** A centralized database stores routes, waypoints, user plans, and reviews.
- **User Contributions:** Users can suggest new routes and provide feedback on existing ones.

2. **Routes & Waypoints** (Trek/Hike/Bike/History Paths)
3. **Points of Interest** (Plants, Animals, Buildings, Landmarks)
4. **Reviews & Contributions** (User Engagement)
5. **Data Sources** (Local Councils, Tourism Boards)

## Tools & Technologies
